# Identifying who are unlikely to benefit from total knee arthroplasty: a machine learning approach

This repository contains the code that we used to train and explain the models for total knee arthroplasty outcome prediction.   
The software we used in the development and their versions can be found in `requirements.txt`.

[Xiaodi Liu](https://github.com/dillys10) also contributes to the development of the code.
